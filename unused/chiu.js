              <p>Prof. Chui-De Chiu obtained his Bachelor of Science in Psychology, M.S. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology at National Taiwan University. During graduate and postgraduate studies, he received training in applying experimental approaches to delineating the cognitive mechanisms of psychopathology (e.g., dissociation, mood disorders, and psychosis). He stayed in Leiden University (The Netherlands) and Central Institute of Mental Health at Mannheim (Germany) as a visiting scholar and then as a scientific researcher from 2012 to 2013. During his time there, he used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neuro-cognitive underpinnings of borderline personality disorder. Prof. Chiu is a trained CBT-oriented therapist. Aside from conventional CBT interventions, he has also done work in mindfulness-based psychotherapy and psychodynamics.</p>

              <p>Two areas of Prof. Chiu's clinical and research interests lie in the impact of aversive interpersonal experience and stressful life events on mental health. In particular, his focus is on the information processing styles which characterize stress-related disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative disorders, and borderline personality disorder. He attempts to clarify the neuro-cognitive mechanisms underlying the symptomatic manifestations of stress-related disorders, and to investigate how these atypical neuro-cognitive operations mediate/moderate the pathogenetic pathway from stressful life events to mental illnesses. His past work mainly surrounds the paradox of pathological trauma memory (i.e., intrusion and amnesia). A new focus of his research is in exploring the role of dysfunctional self-regulation (e.g., self-esteem, shame, and self-versus-other boundary) in stress-related disorders.</p>
